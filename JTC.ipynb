    "# JTC: Javascript Trust Chain JWT Header\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "When issuing x509 SPIFFE SVIDs… usually the workload receiving the SVID is at the end of a chain of certificates, only the root of which is going to necessarily be readily accessible.  You can imagine a series like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spire server root cert\n",
    "* K8s Cluster cert\n",
    "* Node cert\n",
    "* Workload cert\n",
    "\n",
    "JWTs are extremely usable tokens. They even offer options to sign with an X509 cert.  One would like to be able to use a JWT token signed with a Workload cert to assert identity to any receiving workload that trust’s the Spire server root’s trust domain (either directly or via federation of trust domains) even if its not running in the same K8s cluster or on the same Node. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The options provided by JWS RFC 7515 offers a number of choices for header fields to convey information about the signing X509 certificate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* jwk - JWK encoded certificate or certificate chain\n",
    "* jku - a url from which to fetch JWK encoded certificate or certificate chain\n",
    "* x5c - JSON array containing the x509 encoded certificate chain\n",
    "* x5u - url from which to fetch x509 encoded certificate or certificate chain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### jku/x5u\n",
    "jku/x5u urls cannot be easily used to send a receiver of a JWT token to retrieve the Workload cert, which may be inaccessible by the recipient by virtue of being in a different network domain.\n",
    "Additionally, url based retrieval can greatly increase latency of validating JWT tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### jwk/x5c\n",
    "jwk/x5c by presenting the full chain of the certificates used to sign the JWT tempts the recipient to validate the token without validating the certificate chain.  This is error prone.  TLS has similar issues, but the stock TLS libraries have all ‘failed safe’ for this problem.  JWT is much looser and thus more dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "Introduce a new JWT header field:\n",
    "\n",
    "jtc - JSON trust chain.  The ‘jtc’ header is a JSON array of JWTs of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{  // JWT header\n",
    "    alg: // algorithm used for signature\n",
    "    typ:\n",
    "    enc: // algorithm used for encryption\n",
    "    // pick one of x5t,x5u,jku but *not* x5c or jwk\n",
    "    // x5t - fingerprint or thumbnail of x509 key\n",
    "    // x5u - url of x509 key\n",
    "    // jku - url of jwk key\n",
    "}\n",
    "{  // JWT payload\n",
    "    x5e: // x509 certificate encrypted by key indicated in header\n",
    "}\n",
    "{ // JWT signature\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example of:\n",
    "* Spire server root cert\n",
    "* K8s cluster cert\n",
    "* Node cert\n",
    "* Workload cert\n",
    "\n",
    "Spire server root could provide the K8s cluster with a ‘jtc’ using x5t for its finger print.\n",
    "\n",
    "K8s cluster cert could provide the Node with a ‘jtc’ containing the Spire root’s ‘jtc’ with its own ‘jtc’ JWT appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Node could issue a JWT SVID to the Workload with a ‘jtc’ containing the K8s cluster’s ‘jtc’ with its own ‘jtc’ JWT appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workload can then add the ‘jtc’ to JWT tokens it’s signing with its workload X509 cert.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any other workload that receives that JWT token that is either in the trust domain of the Spire server root, or federated with the Spire server root can then validly reconstruct the certificate needed to validate the JWT’s signature because:\n",
    "The receiving workload should have the Spire root’s public key for its fingerprint as a known trusted authority.  It can use that public key to decrypt the K8s cluster’s X509 public key from the Spire root’s ‘jtc’ JWT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the workload has the K8s cluster’s public key, and knows it can trust it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can decrypt the Node’s X509 cert using the K8s cluster’s public key\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the Workloads X509 cert using the Node’s public key\n",
    "\n",
    "This solves the issue with jwk/x5c certificate chains because it is *not possible* for the receiving workload to verify the JWT *unless* it already has (and thus presumably trusts) a public key matching the x5t fingerprint of one of the JWTs in the ‘jtc’ chain or is able to retrieve one of them from the jku/x5u.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching and performance improvements\n",
    "Once the receiving workload has processed the ‘jtc’ from the Workload, it now has and trusts the X509 public keys for the K8s cluster and the Node, and so  can begin unpacking any ‘jtc’s from that K8s Cluster or Node without having to re-decrypt their public keys from the chain.\n",
